# 🎓 VidhyaSetu - Group Payment System Example

## 📱 How the New Group Payment System Works

### **Scenario: 10th Standard Morning Batch**

---

## **Step 1: Owner Generates Payment Link** 🔗

**Owner Action:**
```bash
POST /generate/payment-link
{
  "tuition_id": "687f2425b54088a6c84e933e",
  "standard": "10th",
  "batch_name": "Morning",
  "expires_in": 1
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "payment_url": "http://localhost:3000/payment?token=abc123xyz",
  "standard": "10th",
  "batch_name": "Morning",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-14T10:00:00.000Z",
  "instructions": "Share this link with 10th students for payment verification"
}
```

---

## **Step 2: Owner Shares Link in WhatsApp Group** 📱

**WhatsApp Message:**
```
💰 ABC Tuition Center - Fee Payment

10th Standard - Morning Batch Students

अगर आपने fees भरी है (cash/online) तो इस link पर click करके confirm करें:

http://localhost:3000/payment?token=abc123xyz

Expires: 24 hours
Contact: 9876543210
```

---

## **Step 3: Students Click Link & Fill Form** 📝

**When students click the link, they see:**
- Tuition name and address
- Standard: 10th
- Batch: Morning
- List of all students in that batch
- Form to select their name and enter payment details

**Student fills form:**
```json
{
  "tuition_id": "687f2425b54088a6c84e933e",
  "student_id": "STU-1",  // Selects from dropdown
  "amount": 5000,
  "mode": "cash",
  "date": "2025-01-13",
  "note": "Paid in cash during class"
}
```

---

## **Step 4: Payment Goes to Pending** ⏳

**Response to student:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payment submitted for verification!",
  "payment": {
    "id": "payment_id_123",
    "amount": 5000,
    "mode": "cash",
    "date": "2025-01-13T00:00:00.000Z",
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

---

## **Step 5: Owner Verifies Payment** ✅

**Owner sees in dashboard:**
- Pending payments list
- Student name, amount, mode, date
- Verify/Reject buttons

**Owner clicks "Verify":**
```graphql
mutation {
  verifyFeePayment(id: "payment_id_123") {
    id
    status
    verified_at
  }
}
```

**Payment becomes verified!** ✅
