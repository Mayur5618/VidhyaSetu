# üéì VidhyaSetu - New Features Documentation

## üìù Student Self-Registration System

### Overview
Students can now register themselves without needing login credentials. Tuition owners generate unique registration links and share them with students via WhatsApp or other platforms.

### How It Works

#### 1. Generate Registration Link (Tuition Owner)
```bash
POST /generate/registration-link
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tuition_id": "YOUR_TUITION_ID",
  "standard": "10th",           // Optional: restrict to specific standard
  "batch_name": "Morning",      // Optional: suggest batch name
  "expires_in": 7               // Days until link expires (default: 7)
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "registration_url": "http://localhost:3000/register?token=abc123...",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-20T10:00:00.000Z",
  "instructions": "Share this link with 10th students for registration"
}
```

#### 2. Student Registration (No Login Required)
```bash
POST /register/student
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tuition_id": "YOUR_TUITION_ID",
  "name": "Rahul Kumar",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "address": "123 Main Street, City",
  "standard": "10th",
  "batch_name": "Morning",      // Optional: will create batch if doesn't exist
  "parent_name": "Rajesh Kumar",
  "parent_phone": "9876543211"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Student registered successfully!",
  "student": {
    "id": "student_mongodb_id",
    "custom_id": "STU-123",
    "name": "Rahul Kumar",
    "batch": "Morning"
  }
}
```

## üí∞ Payment Verification System

### Overview
When students pay fees (cash/online), tuition owners can generate payment verification links. Students click the link and confirm their payment details, which creates a pending payment record for owner verification.

### How It Works

#### 1. Generate Payment Link (Tuition Owner)
```bash
POST /generate/payment-link
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tuition_id": "YOUR_TUITION_ID",
  "standard": "10th",           // Optional: restrict to specific standard
  "batch_name": "Morning",      // Optional: restrict to specific batch
  "expires_in": 1               // Days until link expires (default: 1)
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "payment_url": "http://localhost:3000/payment?token=xyz789...",
  "standard": "10th",
  "batch_name": "Morning",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-14T10:00:00.000Z",
  "instructions": "Share this link with 10th students for payment verification"
}
```

#### 2. Student Payment Verification (No Login Required)
```bash
POST /payment/verify
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tuition_id": "YOUR_TUITION_ID",
  "student_id": "STUDENT_ID",
  "amount": 5000,
  "mode": "cash",
  "date": "2025-01-13",
  "note": "Paid in cash during class"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Payment submitted for verification!",
  "payment": {
    "id": "payment_mongodb_id",
    "amount": 5000,
    "mode": "cash",
    "date": "2025-01-13T00:00:00.000Z",
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Owner Verification (GraphQL)
```graphql
# Get pending payments
query {
  getPendingPayments(tuition_id: "YOUR_TUITION_ID") {
    id
    amount
    mode
    date
    status
    student_id {
      name
      custom_id
    }
  }
}

# Verify payment
mutation {
  verifyFeePayment(id: "PAYMENT_ID") {
    id
    status
    verified_at
  }
}

# Reject payment
mutation {
  rejectFeePayment(id: "PAYMENT_ID") {
    id
    status
    verified_at
  }
}
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Changes
- **FeePayment Model**: Added `status`, `verified_at`, `payment_source` fields
- **Student Model**: Added `registration_source` field
- **Auto Batch Creation**: If batch doesn't exist, system creates it automatically
- **Custom IDs**: All new students get unique custom IDs (STU-1, STU-2, etc.)

### Security Features
- **Token Expiration**: Links expire automatically
- **One-time Use**: Payment links can only be used once
- **Validation**: All inputs are validated server-side
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate student registrations and payments

### Frontend Integration
- **No Authentication Required**: Students don't need accounts
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Forms work on all devices
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on form submission
- **Copy Links**: Easy sharing via WhatsApp/email

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com  # For generating proper links
```

### Database Considerations
- **Memory Storage**: Currently using in-memory storage for links (not persistent)
- **Production**: Use Redis or database for link storage
- **Cleanup**: Implement automatic cleanup of expired links

### Security Recommendations
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on registration/payment endpoints
- **Input Sanitization**: Additional input validation for production
- **Logging**: Add comprehensive logging for audit trails
